// Explanation Tasks (Write short answers):


//1. Explain the purpose of the main function in Dart.

// The main function in dart is the first step of start of the code when executed, without main function, the code cannot be started.


//2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

// They are different variable to define exacatly which datatype used:
// var can be any datatype but take the first assigned datatype, for ex:
// if var = 'String', cannot be assigned to a new datatype.
// but dynamic is more flexible, so can be assignet to any datatype without limitation.

// The explicitly variables, are fixed to a specific datatype like : String, int, double, bool
